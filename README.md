#Dog-1.0-'Red Setter'
Many cat's are now too complex and overthinked:
    782  22684  gnu-cat.c
dog is ~ 100 lines long, this means that the binary file is much smaller and that the source code is very easy to read

Dog-1.0 'Red Setter', is a cleaner, simpler re implementation of the UNIX program cat. Dog improves on cat with speed and with features such as pagination (scrolling) and hex dumping (yet to be implemented) for binary files
